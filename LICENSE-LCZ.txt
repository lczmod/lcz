LCZ Mod License

LCZ Mod v1.0 (Also referred to as "LCZ Mod") consists of software components,
resource files and resource sources. In case you received these files packed
into a Valve Source engine BSP file ("BSP file" onwards) and wish to access
the source code & resource files, you can extract them from BSP file,
with instructions available at:
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Bspzip

You can obtain the latest version from git repository:
https://github.com/lczmod/lcz

The basic premise of LCZ Mod license is that you can use any parts of it for
any purpose, commercial or not, as long as you share the parts you've used
under their original licenses and with original notices of authorship.

Two main licenses used by parts of LCZ Mod are GPLv3 and CC BY-SA 4.0.

More specific licensing information can be found below.

This license file must be redistributed along with any works that make use of
unchanged or derivative form of LCZ Mod software components, resource files
or resource sources, in one of the following manners:

 - As a resource included into BSP file, placed in the inner path root
   (that is, full license file path must be "/LICENSE-LCZ.txt").
   
   Resource packing script distro/lcz_pack.cmd will include license file
   into BSP file in this manner by default.
   
 - As a separate file, in the root folder of package that contains the BSP
   file which uses LCZ Mod.

Contents and paths:

The following paths are relative to Git repository root directory.

/distro
LCZ Mod distribution directory.
Contains necessary files for creation of levels using LCZ Mod.

/src
Resource sources contained in several separate sub-directories.
Unless a sub-directory contains a separate license file, its contents are
licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
International License.

If you've obtained LCZ Mod distribution directory (named "distro") without
resource sources, the /distro prefix won't be present in following paths.

Software components can be found under the following directories:
/distro/res/csgo/scripts/vscripts/lcz_v1

Resource files can be found under the following directories:
/distro/res/csgo/materials/models/props_lcz_v1
/distro/res/csgo/models/player/custom_player/lcz_v1
/distro/res/csgo/models/props_lcz_v1
/distro/res/csgo/sound/lcz_v1

License text files for all licenses used in LCZ Mod can be found under the
following directories:
/license
/distro/license

When working with resources embedded in BSP file, remove the /distro/res/csgo
prefix from internal paths. License files must appear in the
internal path root (e.g. /LICENSE-LCZ.txt).
